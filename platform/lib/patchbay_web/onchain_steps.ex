defmodule PatchbayWeb.OnchainSteps do
  @moduledoc """
  The server half of a wallet-button component, as in the Regent template
  (`skills/onchain-buttons` has the rules). `PatchbayWeb.CreditsPanel` uses it.

  The component builds a `RegentChain.Review` for the signer and hands it to
  `put_review/2`, which pushes it to the page before anyone presses. The page
  reports each press against the review it sent from, and every sent step is
  then read at the latest block of the review's chain, every two seconds,
  until it lands or the page stops asking. Nothing is kept beyond the page.

  The only wallet that may act is Privy's active wallet when it is one of the
  signed-in account's own (`signer/2`).
